#  First, the main function 

##  1. Read the point cloud 

  ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574490325
  ```  
   Read the point cloud from the file. When the user does not fill in the extension of the point cloud, it will be automatically decoded; if it is filled in, it will attempt to decode the file according to the extension. 

 1. read_point_cloud used to read point cloud data. Open3D decodes files by file extension. Supported extensions are: pcd, ply, xyz, xyzrgb, xyzn, pts. By default, Open3D tries to infer the file type by file extension. 

##  2. Save the point cloud 

  ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574490325
  ```  
   Save the point cloud to a local folder. 

##  3. Display point cloud 

  ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574490325
  ```  
    Visualize point clouds. Use the mouse/trackpad to view geometric shapes from different angles. Press the H key to print out a complete list of keyboard commands for the GUI. 

##  4. Point cloud formats supported by Open3D 

 You can also read the specified file type, in which case the file extension is ignored.
