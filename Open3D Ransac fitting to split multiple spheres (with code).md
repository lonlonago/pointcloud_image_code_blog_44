#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

   The core principle of the algorithm is still RANSAC spherical fitting. For the specific theory, please refer to: Open3D - RANSAC three-dimensional point cloud spherical fitting. Just slightly modify the code to make it suitable for segmenting multiple spheres in point cloud data.
